# `static-lang-word-lists`

A collection of word lists for various scripts, compressed at build time, baked into the binary, and decompressed lazily at run time.

## Motivation

Include word lists in the binary, don't take up more space than necessary, be publishable on crates.io (10 MiB size limit)

## Usage

On crates.io as `static-lang-word-lists`

For documentation, please refer to [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/static-lang-word-lists).

## How this crate works

A build script that downloads the word lists from GitHub, compresses them with Brotli, and embeds that data in the binary, lazily decompressed at runtime

### Technical details

Note: adding or removing a wordlist requires that `cargo xtask slwl` be re-run.
See the [xtasks' README](../xtask/README.md) for more details on what it's doing.
This README only concerns the build script's role

1. A list of all the supported wordlists is generated by `cargo xtask slwl` (this step is manual and must be run when adding or removing a word list!)
2. The build script reads the list of paths generated by the xtask (`chicken.rs`, which is `include!`d in the build script)
3. If building from remote sources, a zipball of the repo is downloaded from GitHub, and the selected word lists are extracted (word lists may be enabled or disabled through feature flags)
4. Selected word lists are compressed with brotli (compression level is reduced in debug builds to speed up crate build time) and are written to `OUT_DIR` under their relative path, where `static-lang-word-lists/src/declarations.rs` is expecting them

## Developing

To build using local files, set the `STATIC_LANG_WORD_LISTS_LOCAL` environment variable
